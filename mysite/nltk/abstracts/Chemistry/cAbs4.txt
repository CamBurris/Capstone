The objective of this project is to determine whether or not different gasses have different weights or weight at
all.
The five gasses I tested were acetylene, argon, carbon dioxide, helium and oxygen. I weighed
these gasses by filling each balloon with a different gas. Each balloon was weighed prior to filling it with gas. Once the
balloon was filled with gas, it was submerged in a five gallon bucket. The five gallon bucket contained 2 gallons of water.
The interior of the bucket was marked with 100 cubic inch markers above the two gallon line. Each 100 cubic inch mark
equalled 277 fluid ounces of water. Once the balloon was submerged entirely underwater, I slowly let the gas out until the
water level dropped down to the 500 cubic inch mark. Each balloon was then tied, dried off and weighed on a triple beam
balance scale. I tested each gas 10 times, to assure accurate results.
My results indicated that gasses do have different weights. I found that Carbon Dioxide was the heaviest and that
Helium was the lightest. Oxygen is also lighter than Carbon Dioxide by nearly 75%. My project reflected the different
molecular weights for each gas. Carbon Dioxide has a molecular weight of 44.0 and Oxygen has a molecular weight of
32.0.
This was a very interesting project, which identified that gasses do have weight and weigh differently. It is
also a very interesting project because of the fact that something which is invisible has weight. This is a basic project that
can be looked into even further by exploring more gasses. I enjoyed learning about the characteristics of the gasses, which
are all useful or essential to life on earth.
