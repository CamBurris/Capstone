My project’s objective is to prove that carbon dioxide is soluble in water, and to see how temperature affects it.
Hypothesis: I believe that carbon dioxide is soluble in water and that increasing temperature will decrease its solubility.
At room temperature I was able to show that carbon dixide was in the water because, I was able to separate the
white solid (calcium carbonate) from the liquid by continuously decanting and using a siphon (actually a baster). Then I
allowed the little remaining water to evaporate and the calcium carbonate to dry as a nice powder. The amount of calcium
carbonate was so small I had to go to a pharmacy to use their scale to measure my results. I was able to tell before being
able to use the scale at the pharmacy, the diffferences of the amount of calcium carbonate by comparing their relative
volume in the small vials I had put them in. Using this technique I was able to determine that there as approximately twice
as much CO

dissolved at 40 F than at 70 F. Although it was very small, there still was some carbon dioxide in the water
heated to 165 F, which came as a surprise to me because I didn’t expect to see any. This fits with my hypotheses, but not at
the amounts I had expected.
My conclusion is that yes, carbon dioxide is soluble in water and the amount depends on the temperature of
the water. The maximum amount of solubility is found close to the freezing temperature of water. The solubility decreases
as the temperature rises. I found that at the maximum temperature used in my experiment, 165 degrees of Fahrenheit, that
there was very little carbon dioxide left in the water. If carbon dioxide causes global warming, then the problem will
continue to get worse as the earth heats up, because the rise in temperature causes more carbon dioxide to be released from
the earth’s water.
