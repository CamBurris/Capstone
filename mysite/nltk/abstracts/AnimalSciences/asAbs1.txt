My project was to determine whether or not honeybees can tell the difference between sucrose and
other sugars sprayed on flowers, and which they prefer. My hypothesis was that most bees would visit sucrose,
since it is in nectar.
Four different sugar solutions made of dextrose, sucrose, fructose, lactose or plain
water were mixed with water. Equal amounts of each solution were sprayed on five separate pansies and placed
equal distances in front of a beehive. The number of bee visits to each flower within 40 minutes was counted,
and sugars were rinsed off of the flowers. Then tests were repeated as five sugars were sprayed on different
flowers, which were moved to different positions in front of the hive.
In an average of all results, 30% of bee visits were to sucrose as opposed to the 19% visits received by
fructose and water, the second most visited solutions. Flowers sprayed with lactose were visited by 16% of all
bees, and 15% visited dextrose.
My conclusion is that since bees are accustomed to eating sucrose nectar, it is the sugar they are
most likely to visit. Sucrose must have qualities that other sugars lack. With this experiment, I was able to attain
my objective.
