This experiment is to determine if carp eat more and therefore grow faster at the higher or lower end
of their optimal temperature range.
A tank was set up with water, a filter, a heater, and a thermometer. The temperature
was regulated to 24
EC. Two carp were weighed and introduced into the tank. They were fed all they wanted for
two weeks. Then they were weighed again at the end of the two weeks. This procedure was repeated at 28
EC.
The fish that were kept at 24 EC ate 3½ Tbs. of fish food, and gained 2.66 oz. The fish that were kept
at 28 EC ate 6 Tbs. of fish food and gained 3.32 oz. There was a difference in how much was eaten and how
much weight was gained at the different temperatures.
The results of the experiment show that carp eat more and grow faster at the higher end of their
optimal temperature range. This shows that water temperature can make a significant difference in the growth of
carp.
