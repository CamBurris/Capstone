An experiment was conducted to determine the influence of short-term food deprivation on the altered foraging
behavior in Avacularia avacularia (tarantula).
The experiment was conducted by using twelve adult French Guiana Pinktoe tarantulas, known to be a sit-and-
wait predator. They were housed in separate two liter containers. Each was labeled one through twelve. They
were grouped 1-4, 5-8 and 9-12. One day one of each experimental trial groups were fed. Three days later,
groups 1-4 and 5-8 were observed for two hours in a dark room with the aid of a dim red light. Their behavior
was recorded every fifteen minutes, noting any changes in position. !-4 were then fed one cricket each. For
another hour, the two groups were observed. This was repeated two days later when 5-8 were fed and 9-12
unfed. Then two days later 9-12 were fed and the other two groups were unfed.
Observations and statistics showed that the groups that remained unfed for longer periods of time engaged in
increased displays of foraging behavior in comparison to the tarantulas who were fed more recently. The
longer the period of food deprivation, the more the species displayed acts of foraging behavior.
