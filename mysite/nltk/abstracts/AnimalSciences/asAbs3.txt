This project was executed to determine if hermit crabs preferred fresh water snail shells,
washed down from the Carpinteria Salt Marsh, over marine snail shells commonly found in the Carpinteria tide
pools. My hypothesis was that hermit crabs did indeed prefer fresh water snail shells over those of marine origin
because the majority of the hermit crabs observed in these tide pools inhabited the fresh water snail shells from
the salt marsh.
Eighteen hermit crabs were gathered from the tide pool at the Carpinteria
State Beach. They were then placed in a 13" x 48" glass aquarium divided into eight equal chambers. Each
chamber included equal numbers of olivella, fresh water, horn and miscellaneous snail shells that had been
matched to the size of the shell that the crab had occupied when harvested. They were observed daily and the
shell that they were occupying was recorded.
50% of all the crabs chose olivella shells, while 28% chose fresh water shells, and 22% chose
miscellaneous shells. None of the crabs selected horn shells. These numbers greatly differed from the shells that
they had been found in at the tide pool, which were 45% fresh water, 44% olivella, and 11% miscellaneous.
The results of this experiment show that hermit crabs prefer olivella shells over the fresh
water snail shells, which was against my hypothesis. I believe the crabs in the tide pools are selecting fresh
water shells because there is an abundance of them. This experiment has added to my understanding of the
nature of hermit crabs and has created even more questions that I intend to answer.
