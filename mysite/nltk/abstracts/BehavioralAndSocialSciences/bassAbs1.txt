The objective is to determine if different diets positively or negatively affect a mouse#s memory of
running a maze.
Three mice were fed with different diets: fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. The fat
diet consisted of peanut butter and sunflower seeds; the protein diet of dog biscuits and alfalfa blocks; the
carbohydrate diet of wheat crackers and bread. The mice were tested each night for six nights on one diet. They
were timed to see how fast they could finish a maze. The maze configuration was changed for each diet so that
the mice would not build on their previous learning.
Carbohydrates most significantly and positively affected the memory, followed by protein and fat,
respectively.
The hypothesis was supported by the experiment conducted. Carbohydrates promote the entry of
neurotransmitters into the brain; the more neurotransmitters there are, the easier it is to memorize maze
patterns. Protein has been shown to be linked to memory in many past experiments. There was no strong
reason why fat slightly affect memory positively.
