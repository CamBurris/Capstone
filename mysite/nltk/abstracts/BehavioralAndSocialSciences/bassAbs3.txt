The objective of my experiment was to see how the amount of time after witnessing a crime affected the accuracy of
eyewitness testimony
As the amount of time increases after witnessing a crime, the amount of information about the crime accurately
remembered by the eyewitness will decrease. Also, most witnesses who are interviewed even immediately after seeing the crime
will not be 100 percent accurate.
In this experiment, four classrooms of girls (82 girls) were divided into four groups: Group A, Group B, Group C, and
Group D. Each group was shown a video of a bank robbery from the movie "Bonnie and Clyde". Group A was tested (given
questions having certain point values) on the robbery immediately after seeing the crime, Group B was tested one day after seei
ng
the crime, Group C was tested one week after seeing the crime, and Group D was tested a month after seeing the crime. The poin
ts
each group earned for accuracy, lost for inaccuracy, and lost for not knowing information were then calculated and compared.
Group A, tested immediately after witnessing the crime, had an accuracy rate of 47.762 percent, which linearly decreased
among the groups as time passed, with Group D, tested one month after witnessing the crime, having an accuracy rate of 24.714
percent. The inaccuracy rates were about the same for each group. Group A had a rate for unknown information of 40.905 percen
t,
which linearly increased among the groups as time passed, with Group D having a rate for unknown information of 62.262 percent.
These results proved my hypothesis to be correct. The reason eyewitnesses did not remember all of the information of
the crime was probably due to the passage of time and a lack of attention while witnessing the crime, not allowing all of the
information to enter or be maintained in long-term memory.
