My objective was to determine if laughter can be proven to be beneficial in a learning environment.
The latest research shows it can increase awareness, release tension, commit facts to deeper memory, and
enhance the outcome of group activities. With this in mind, I hope to prove that laughter can be an important
tool to improve learning.
Twenty-four students wee tested in various learning skills, with and without the use of
laughter. My project is divided into sections according to the following skills: memory (visual & audio),
concentration, team participation, and comprehension. Averages were determined and compared.
Visual memory increased in almost every case, with the greatest improvement for lower scoring
students. Audible memory increased 15% with humor. Concentration testing shows a slight improvement, but
again the most significant results are for lower achievers. The group activity changed dramatically with the use
of laughter. Substantial differences in communication, leadership and overall group coordination were noted.
My hypothesis was proven correct, laughter is an important learning tool with the greatest benefit
to lower achievers. Laughter provides the extra stimulus that these students need. Educators need to be made
aware of the potential of laughter for improving the coordination of a group of students and about the many
ways that laughter can be beneficial. Laughter adds to your happiness, your health, and as I have now proven,
your learning ability.
