Our objective was to develop a test that would be able to induce false memories into the
participants of our experiment. We wanted to study how people are able to convince themselves
that they saw or experienced something they did not. We used a list of twelve words, which
were all related to another "key" word from the lists that were made. We told the participants to
study the list, and then gave them a "test" on what they remembered. This test included several
words from the list, several unrelated words, and the "key" word from which the lists were
produced. We asked them to chose those words that were on the first list, and give how
confident they were of their answers, on a scale of 1-5 next to their answers. We successfully
generated lists that were able to repeatedly show evidence of false memories, however for
further study we are currently studying the differences in these results between sex and age
groups.
