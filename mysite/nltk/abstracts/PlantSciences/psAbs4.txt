Our objective was to determine if the pH of a solution affected the photosynthetic rate of the aquatic
plant Anachalis. We believed the plants would perform most efficiently in the neutral solution.
To alter the pH of the solutions, we added either hydrochloric acid (for our
three acid tests) or sodium hydroxide (for our three base tests) to the water. Our control was neutral test group
with a pH of seven. The pH of each sample was determined with pH paper. We placed the different plant
samples (all with the same mass) into their appropriate graduated cylinders, each filled with their test#s solution.
These were then placed upside down into beakers of the corresponding solution. Their photosynthesis was
monitored by the amount of oxygen that accumulated at the top of their cylinders (noted in milliliters).
The plant sample in the acidic solution continuously produced more oxygen then the other two
sample types.
Our results were contrary to our hypothesis. The acidic solution provided
a more efficient environment for photosynthesis. These results are important because they can help predict how
much acid rain the plant life of an aquatic ecosystem can sustain before permanent damage. They can also help
decide on the proper pH for a plant aquarium.
