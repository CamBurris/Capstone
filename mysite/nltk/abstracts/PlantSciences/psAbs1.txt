The experiment studies the effect of growth rate of plants in a smaller or bigger environment. The
experimental hypothesis is: plants in big pots will do fine in growth. The plants in the smaller pots
will be smaller than those grown in regular size pots.
The study was conducted by first sprouting some seeds. The sprouted seeds were planted in different
sized pots. Second, the plants were measured everyday. The third step was to record plant
measurements, room temperature, and the amount of water given. The last step was to dump out the
pots and observe the roots at the end of the growth period.
In this study, the plants planted in the smaller pots did just as well as the ones in the bigger pots.
Regressions were performed to tell if there was a statistical relationship between the pot size and plant
growth. These regressions proved that pot size is not a good predictor of plant growth. The only
difference was the roots. The root system on the ones in the big pots had normal sized roots. The
ones in the middle, had adequate roots. The plants grown in the smaller pots had very small roots.
