The goal of my project is to determine if the age of corn seeds affects germination. I think that the
older the seeds the less likely they are to germinate.
Corn seeds from seven different years were germinated in plastic cups and in
the soil. Six seeds from each year were put in clear cups with black paper lining and wet cotton balls for
moisture so that I could measure the length of the root and stem daily. Six seeds from each year were also
planted in soil and watered. I recorded how many seeds sprouted from each year.
I found out that seeds from the four most recent years germinated in the soil and in the cups. Most
of the seeds older than 1996 didn’t germinate. The 2001, 2000, and 1999 seeds grew longer roots and stems on
average and grew faster than the 1996 seeds.
The results I got in my first experiment and again in a duplication of the experiment support
my hypothesis. I learned that you should throw away old corn seeds because the old seeds seldom germinate.
A farmer or a gardener should plant the newest corn seeds available.
