The objective of this project was to compare DNA strand damage in sperm of 5 smokers as compared to a
non-smoker; and of 5 men who were enrolled in a Smoking Cessation Program who either quit smoking or continued to
smoke.
Sperm was collected at Time 1, at 6 and 12 weeks after enrolling in a Smoking Cessation
Program. DNA damage was assessed by a COMET assay, which measured the DNA head intensity, tail length and tail
moment, which is the ratio DNA head intensity and tail length. DNA strand breakage is usually repaired by the sperm or
by the egg at fertilization. Sometimes, however, the damage cannot be corrected or is incorrectly repaired thus making an
abnormality in the offspring.
Data showed that smokers when compared to a non-smoker had greater DNA strand damage at all time points. In
addition, smokers who quit smoking when compared to smokers who continued smoking had improved DNA integrity at 6
and 12 weeks after enrollment in a Smoking Cessation Program.
These findings suggest that smoking cessation might lead to recovery from smoking-induced
DNA damage. If improvement in DNA damage does occur when a man stops smoking, this would be important
information to convey to a smoker who is planning to have a family.
