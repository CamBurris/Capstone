Stereotypy and Locomotor Activity test were performed using mouse strains NR1flox +CR1cre
(mutants) and NR1flox-CA1cre (wild-type) to determine whether there is a significant difference
of response to N-menthyl#D-asparate (NMDA) antagonist MK-801 and the antipsychotic agent
clozapine. Reduced levels of NMDA receptors located in the brain are linked to the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia such as delusions, hallucinations and disorganized behavior.
Clozapine antagonizes the MK-801 induced activities in both #mutant# (reduced amount of
NMDA receptors in the hippocampus) and #wild type# mice (do not lack NMDA receptors).
The behavior seen in the #mutant# mice for the stereotypy counts supports the hypothesis that
NMDA receptors are linked to schizophrenia and that the hippocampus is significant as well. If
the hippocamptal region is linked to schizophrenia then there will not be an increase or
exacerbation of behavior when mutants are given NMDA antagonist. However the data from
the locomotor activity experiments show that there is an increase or exacerbation of activity for
mutant mice when given MK-801; thus suggesting that schizophrenia is not directly a result of a
decrease in NMDA receptors in the hippocampus but has other origins as well.
