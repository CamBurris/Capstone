My project was to see how a daphnia’s heart rate is affected by solutions of tobacco, cola, cough
syrup, and ethyl alcohol. I believe that the heart rate would beat faster when I introduced the cola and tobacco,
and the heart rate would beat slower when the cough syrup and ethyl alcohol was introduced.
I used 4 different solutions of cola, tobacco tea, cough syrup containing
dextromenthorphen hydromide, and ethyl alcohol, each diluted with 50% aged tap water. I put a single daphnia
on the slide and counted its heart rate for 3 consecutive times to determine it’s normal heart rate. I then put a
50% solution on the slide with the daphnia, waited one minute and counted it’s heart rate. I did this count 3
times for the daphnia in the solution. I repeated the experiment twice for each solution with a new daphnia on a
clean slide each time.
The daphnia’s heart rate in the stimulant solutions always increased. The daphnia in the depressant
solutions heart rate decreased.
My results supported my hypothesis. I believe that my results show that by using every day
products, stimulants and depressants can change heart rate.
