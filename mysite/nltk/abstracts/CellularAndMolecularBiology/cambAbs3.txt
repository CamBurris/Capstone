In our project, we attempted to compare a standard method of protein and protein digestion observation (running
electrophoresis gels) with a new proprietary method developed by Signature BioScience, multi-coupling spectroscopy, by
characterizing digestions of both HSA and fibrinogen using each method.
We prepared the protein solutions by buffering our protein samples in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
We then prepared protease solution by buffering crude protease in hydrochloric acid (HCL). For electrophoresis, we prepared 8
time-lapse protein digestion solutions, stopping digestion after intervals of 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60 minutes and overnight usin
g 2-
mercaptoethanol. We then ran SDS-PAGE electrophoresis gels with the samples and a lane for a molecular weight ladder. For
multi-coupling spectroscopy, we loaded a 200ul "plug" of protein solution over the resonator to establish a baseline, and then
mixed
2ul of protease solution with another 200ul of protein solution and loaded that plug over the resonator. We then collected data
at
60-second intervals until the digestion had appeared to have stopped.
We obtained successful results for both procedures using both proteins. The time-lapse electrophoresis gels show the
protein being digested into smaller and smaller polypeptide fragments over time, while the MCS graphs depict the changing
dielectric properties and spectroscopy resonances.
While the standard time-lapse electrophoresis gel method provides valuable (if not precise) information regarding the
size of the polypeptide fragments, MCS has much more to offer. Not only does it allow for quicker experiments and the use of
proteins in their native solutions, but the results are more precise, in the form of spreadsheets with exact numbers that can
be
manipulated easily after an experiment. Also, different types of measurements are recorded, such as the changing spectroscopy
curve and the dielectric properties graph.
