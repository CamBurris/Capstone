The researcher conducting this project wanted to find if essential genes were better conserved
through evolution than non-essential genes using a series of database inquiries to compare
genetic makeup of genes and related how well they have been conserved in other organisms to
their function and how this relates to their conservation.
The series of database inquiries involved using sources such as BDGP (Berkeley Drosophila
Genome Database) to find the amino acid sequences and functions of certain Drosophila genes.
The amino acid sequences of these Drosophila genes in the zeste-white chromosomal region
were used and compared to those of other mapped organisms such as mus musculus and Homo
sapiens as well as realizing that observed functions that have been seen in humans occur in
Drosophila and mice as well as sharing a set of strikingly similar amino acid sequences.
Mostly essential genes were found to be conserved and the researcher is still to chart the data
and repeat the process before anything could be concluded.
