This experiment is to find out whether the amount of plasmid DNA affect the growth of the E.
coli on the antibiotic plates and the antibiotic,"sugar" plates. This project is also trying to prove
if bacteria can be antibiotic resistant. This experiment is to learn about genetic transformation.
It is to make E. coli K-12 strain: HB101 antibiotic resistant by using plasmid DNA(it is
benificial to bacteria survival)and to see the colonies by using a piece of DNA(which has a green
florescent protein)from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. This can be seen under a florescent
lamp. The amount of plasmid will effect the growth of the E. coli and will be antibiotic resistant.
The E. coli was antibiotic resistant with the help from the plasmid DNA. Actually the amount of
plasmid did not effect the growth of the E. coli. The two loops of plasmid had more effect on
the E. coli than the thirty-two loops of plasmid. Very weird!! It must depend on how quickly
the E. coli adapt to the plasmid. That is another theory I need to investigate!
