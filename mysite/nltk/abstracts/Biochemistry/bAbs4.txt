To determine if the frequency of ultraviolet light-induced sister chromatid exchanges is elevated in cells derived
from patients with the sum sensitive genetic disease Xeroderma Pigmentosum.
Cells from normal human, an XP patient, normal Chinese hamster CHO and a UV sensitive CHO mutant line
were cultured in the laboratory. After irradiation with UV light of 254 nm wavelength, the cells were cultured in medium
containing bromodeoxyuradine for 2 cell generations. The cells were then harvested from the cultured dish, burst by a
hypotonic solution and their chromosomes spread on a slide. Under a microscope, the chromosomes were photographed
and the SCE#s were counted from the photographs.
Because I had difficulties finding good chromosome spread from the human cells, the professor I was working
with suggested that I use normal Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and a UV-sensitive CHO mutant (UV-135) as a
model for the normal human and XP cells. I found that the CHO UV-135 cell line irradiated with 0.5 Joules/meter2 had a
higher level of SCE#s than normal CHO cells irradiated with 1 or 3 J/m2. The limited data and I have from normal human
and XP cells do confirm that XP cells have higher levels of UV-induced SCE#s than normal human cells.
My results with both the UV-sensitive CHO UV-135 cell line and XP cells demonstrated that UV sensitivity is
associated with increased levels of UV induced sister chromatid exchanges. This is consistent with the hypothesis that cells
which cannot excise UV-induced pyrimidine dimers from their DNA have difficulties replicating their DNA and that
SCE#s are a mechanism used by cells to get a copy of DNA free of pyrimidine dimers as a template to complete replication
of the whole genome.
