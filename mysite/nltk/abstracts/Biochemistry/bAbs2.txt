To determine if the amount of light that a plant receives affects the amount of protein in the leaves of the plant,
specifically the protein RuBisCO which is the major protein present in leaves. My hypothesis is that plants grown in direct
sunlight will have more proteins and will grow bigger and stronger.
I grew six black-eyed bean plants under indentical conditions except for the amount of light that
they received. Two plants were each exposed to direct light, indirect light, and total darkness. On the twelfth day, I took
two leaves from each plant to the lab to be analyzed. I punched a 6 mm sample from each leaf and ground them in tubes
with glass beads and buffer to extract the proteins. Then I spun the tubes in a centrifuge and used the supernatant to
analyze the protein content by adding a blue colored reagent with a spectrophotometer. To see the individual proteins in
the samples, I used polyacrylamide gels and the electrophoresis process.
First, the plants that were exposed to direct sunlight had a higher protein content compared to the other two
samples. Second, the levels of RuBisCO were clearly decreased in the plants that were in total darkness. Finally, plants in
direct sunlight were stronger but much smaller than the other plants.
The results did not completely support my hypothesis. Compared to plants grown in reduced light, plants
grown in direct sunlight were stronger but were not tall and did not have large leaves even though the protein levels were
greater. This suggests that the plants that received less light were attempting to adapt in order to survive by structural
modification and were weak and the leaves were pale in color. I could obtain more information from these studies by
running more resolving polyacrylamide gels to see differences in other proteins present in the leaves and also by including
some biochemical assays that would measure the activity of some of these proteins.
