The objective of this experiment is to determine if concrete is the best material for use as a sound
barrier, and if not, what is the best material for this purpose.
Seven different materials were selected to be tested for their effectiveness at both
blocking and absorbing sound. The tests were done in an isolated environment within a large box. In this box, a
recording device was placed at one end to provide "white noise", or static, at a constant sound level of 70dB. A
digital sound level meter was placed at the other end of the box. With these two devices in place, the different
materials were consecutively arranged within the box, in a manner designed to allow optimal sound blocking and
absorbing capabilities.
The results of this experiment showed that acoustical tile is the best sound barrier material out of the
seven materials tested. The results also showed that concrete, a material very commonly used for freeway sound
barriers, ranked sixth out of seven materials for this purpose.
This experiment demonstrated that concrete is not the best material for use as a sound barrier. In
this study there were in fact several other materials that were more effective as sound barrier materials, which
suppported my hypothesis.
