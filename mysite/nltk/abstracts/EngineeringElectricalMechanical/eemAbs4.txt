My project examines how density of various sound proofing materials effects the sound attenuation at a
number of audible frequencies. Assuming a relationship between frequency and density exists, I will attempt to create a
single composite that contains three materials, each with a different density to best attenuate one frequency range. I will
then determine if my inexpensive composite performs better than an expensive and commonly used sound proofing
material.
My apparatus consists of a 4#x 4#x2# box with a speaker mounted on one end and a decibel meter placed on the
other. A frequency generator and an amplifier are hooked to the speaker to make sounds at different frequencies and
loudness. To measure the attenuation of different samples, the amplifier is calibrated to output 80dB while the box is
empty. Take a reading after placing a material between the speaker and dB meter. To determine the attenuation, subtract
the reading from eighty. Repeat for all materials at eight frequencies.
I predict that density of a material is proportional to frequencies effectively blocked. I believe materials with
a high density will block low frequencies effectively and materials with a low density will block high frequencies
effectively. I predict my three-layer composite will perform better at a wide range of frequencies than traditional
soundproofing material.
As predicted, density determines which frequencies are effectively blocked. However, higher densities block
all frequencies well, whereas low density materials only block high frequencies. My composite performed almost as well
as the acoustical paneling.
