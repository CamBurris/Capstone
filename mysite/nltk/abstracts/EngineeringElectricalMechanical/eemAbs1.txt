Our project was to determine, of the following three bridges (Semi-Pony Girder, Queen
Post, and Pratt Truss), which will withstand the most weight when the weight is applied from above.
Three model bridges were built from popsicle sticks using the Semi-Pony
Girder, Queen Post, and Pratt Truss designs. The bridges were weighed individually and their weights recorded.
Bridges were placed on a table and weight was added. Using books as weights, the weight was added one at a
time until the bridge structure gave way. The weight of the books was recorded and used for comparison later
Our results showed that the Semi-Pony Girder held the most weight and in our experiment showed
it to be the strongest. Of the remaining two bridges, the Queen Post was the weakest.
Two of us thought the Semi-Pony Girder would be the strongest. One thought the Pratt
Truss would hold the most weight, while the remaining member thought the Queen Post would win. Our results
showed that the Semi-Pony Girder won the weight test due to the structural design and it included more
popsicle sticks.
