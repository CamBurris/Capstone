The objective of this project was to test different lever lengths in Mouse Trap Cars, and to record the time
of travel and distance of each run. The hypothesis was that the longer the lever, the farther the distance traveled,
but the slower the time of travel. The shorter the lever, the shorter the distance traveled, but the faster the time
of travel. Before the tests were run, background information was gathered on Mouse Trap Cars, energy, force,
and motion.
In order to test the Mouse Trap Car’s time and distance traveled, a tape measure, stop watch, and clear
runway was needed. Lever lengths of 30, 27.5, 25, 22.5, and 20 cm were tested. Each group was tested in series
of ten, for a total of fifty runs. After the results were gathered, charts were produced, and then conclusions
were drawn. The data supported the hypothesis that the shorter the lever, the greater the speed, yet the shorter
distance traveled. Likewise, the longer the lever, the slower the speed, yet the farther the distance traveled.
