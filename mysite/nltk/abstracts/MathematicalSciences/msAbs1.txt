This project endeavors to study changes in the values of the integral from 0 to a of cx^n , as one of
the parameters a, c, or n, change as the other two remain fixed. That is, how will the integrals, from zero to
some constant a, where a is a natural number, of the nth order monomial, cx^n, where c and n are also natural
numbers, change, (I) as c increases from 1 to 10, with a and n fixed, (II) as n increases from 1 to 10, with c and
a fixed, (III) as a increases from 1 to
10, with c and n fixed, and (IV) as both n and a change, with c fixed at 1?
1)We used the definite integral feature of TI-83 Plus to find a number of definite integrals. We
observed how the values of the integrals changed as a, c, and n were changed and looked for a pattern. 2) Using
Microsoft Excel and its formula features we were able to create the sub-cases presented here. After having
Excel calculate the definite integrals, we used the TI-83 Plus again to confirm that the numbers attained were
indeed the correct integrals for the given nth order monomials. 3) Using algebra and calculus we found what the
general difference between two concurrent integrals was. The validity of the formulas was confirmed by
plugging in values and comparing them to the numerical data that we attained from Excel and the TI 83 Plus.
As a result of this study it was determined that the concurrent values of the integrals do in fact
exhibit patterns, though they may be hard to see. The formulas for these differences can be used to find other
integrals in the family, without actually using integration techniques.
