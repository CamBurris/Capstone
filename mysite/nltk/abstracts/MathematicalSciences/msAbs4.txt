My goal was to take recorded sound waveforms and approximate them with a sum of simple sine
functions.
First, I recorded multiple pitches from various musical instruments and devices with a
digital recording device called a minidisc. I downloaded the sounds onto my computer through the sound card.
A program allowed me to see and print out the waveforms of my recorded tones. To approximate the
waveforms, I used a guess-and-check strategy and plugged the estimated sine equations into Maple, an
advanced math computer program that could graph the equations for me. I compared the graphs against the
waveforms to check my approximation.
Visually, I was able to get close to matching 5 of the originally recorded waveforms with sine functions.
Waveforms with a clear tone can be approximated with a sum of sine functions; however, the
approximation is difficult using only guess-and-check.
