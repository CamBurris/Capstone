The purpose of this project was to determine the magnet size, vehicle size, power requirements,
and others factors necessary to propel a model car with electromagnets. It was possible to propel a model car with a weight of 230 grams and a length of 17.75 centimeters
using electromagnets constructed of bolts 5/8 of an inch in diameter and 3 inches in length (metric
measurements would be inaccurate in this case), wound with 24-gauge wire and powered by 12 volts and 2.5
amps. The metal strip on the bottom of the car needed to be about 1.5 centimeters from the magnets. It was
possible to propel the car only if the magnets were #fired# at the right speed using a hand-powered switch.
With smooth firing, acceleration increased from one magnet to the next It is possible to propel a model car smoothly using electromagnetic propulsion, given the
right conditions. #Firing# the magnets via computer might be a way to get the vehicle to move reliably and at a
constant speed. Because acceleration can increase from one magnet to the next, if firing of the magnets
could be automated, this propulsion system could be used to launch model airplanes.
