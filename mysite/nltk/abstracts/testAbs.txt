The experiment is to find out which type of bridge design is the most efficient. Five bridge designs were
selected. The beam bridge, arch bridge, truss bridge, stayed bridge and the suspension bridge were loaded and
then compared to their weight.
The experimental hypothesis is that the suspension bridge would hold the most weight but most likely weigh
the most.
In order to test the bridges, designs had to be selected, materials were gathered and plans were made. First,
standard roadways were built to make the bridges as similar as possible. Then each bridge design was built to
support the roadway. The bridges were then brought to Vons to weigh them. The testing started after the
weighing of the bridges.
After the testing and reviewing the results the hypothesis was found to be true. The suspension bridge held
the most weight at 8lb and 12oz, and weighed .16 lb. The truss bridge came in second place by holding 8lb and
8oz. The surprise was that it weighed .8 lb., half of the suspension bridge. A strength factor was calculated to
compare the bridge designs. This factor equaled the division of the load carried by the mass of the bridge. The
truss bridge had the highest strength factor
