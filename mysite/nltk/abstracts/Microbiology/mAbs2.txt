The growth and mutation rate of the yeast (Saccharomyces cervisiae) exposed to UV-C rays for
varying times was studied. The
depletion of the ozone is of great importance because the ozone absorbs the most dangerous form of
Ultraviolet light, UV-C rays. Thus it is important to study the effects this hazardous form of
Ultraviolet light will have on our own cells. Because of the many similarities between yeast cells and
human cells, the results from the experiment can be applied to human cells. One group of yeast plates
was exposed to the UV-C light immediately after being streaked, while a second set was exposed to
UV-C light two days after being streaked. Within the variable groups each plate within the groups was
exposed to the UV-C light source for a range of 1 to 4 hours. The control involved the growth of yeast
in the absence of UV-C irradiation. In observing the first variable group they had a dramatically slower
growth rate and very different morphology than both the second variable and control. The second
variable group grew at a slower rate than the control group but at a faster rate than the first variable
group, maintaining the same morphology as that of the control. As the time exposure within the plates
of the two variable groups decreased the more colonies of yeast were able to grow. Overall, the data
shows that the UV-C rays caused some mutation and growth rate inhibition in the yeast colonies
studied.
