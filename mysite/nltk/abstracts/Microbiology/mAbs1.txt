The objective of my experiment was to find out if garlic has antibacterial properties, and if these
properties are affected by heating or elapsed time.
Different strengths of garlic juice in distilled water were made at 0 percent garlic
juice (control), 25 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent, and 100 percent garlic juice. Two batches of these solutions
were made. One batch was left at room temperature and one was heated. Paper discs soaked in these solutions
were placed in agar plates cultured with E. coli. Two plates were cultured for each strength, and each plate had
three discs. The plates were incubated for twenty-four hours, removed, and any inhibition of bacterial growth
was recorded. The plates were incubated for another twenty-four hours, removed, and observations were
recorded again.
The garlic juice inhibited bacterial growth. The zone of inhibition increased in correspondence with
the strength of garlic juice. Heating the garlic juice did not affect its inhibitory action. Results remained
unchanged at forty-eight hours.
Garlic juice does demonstrate bacterial inhibitory properties, which do not seem to be affected by
heating or a short period of elapsed time.
