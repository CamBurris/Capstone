My objective was to determine which is more effective in killing bacteria, antibacterial or regular soap. My
original hypothesis was that antibacterial and regular soap will be similar in effectiveness. Possibly, less bacteria will
remain or grow after washing with antibacterial soap.
A comparison was made of hand washing with regular and antibacterial Suave soap. Samples
were made by touching a potato-beef broth-gelatin medium with unwashed and washed fingertips. The samples were
incubated for several days in the dark at room temperature. Every eight to twelve hours samples were observed and
bacterial growth recorded.
The experiment showed that even after three washings bacteria were still present on the fingertips. After
incubation, bacterial colonies were present on all samples except the controls. The number of bacteria present on the
growth medium innoculated by the unwashed fingertips was very high. After the first wash, the number of bacteria
significantly decreased relative to the unwashed samples. The number of bacterial colonies increased after the hands were
washed for a second time. After the third wash, the number of bacterial colonies decreased again.
The experiment proved that factors other than the type of soap play a big part in the reduction of bacteria.
After the first wash, all samples showed reduced bacteria, but there was no difference between regular and antibacterial
soap. After the second and third washes, the antibacterial soap samples showed a lower number of colonies. This indicates
that the number of bacteria has been decreased, or that an antibacterial residue left by the soap slows bacterial growth.
