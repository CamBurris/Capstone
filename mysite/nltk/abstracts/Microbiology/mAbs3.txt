The objective of my project is to determine whether the types or materials of shoes affect the amount of bacteria in the
shoes, thus causing the odor.
First I wore the same pair of shoes for three days in a row doing normal activities.
I wore socks for the sneakers, loafers and slip-on shoes (synthetic closed-toe) and no socks for the dance shoes (leather cl
osed-
toe) and sandals as I normally do.
 Next I sterilized the cotton swab by microwaving it and dabbing it in a solution made of boiled water with 10% salt.
 Then I scraped along the inside of the shoes and my feet separately and rubbed it on the two types of agar (Tryptic Soy and
Nutrient Agar), using new cotton swab for each divided surface. I tested not only the shoes but also the feet to see if the a
mount of
bacteria on the skin is consistent throughout the experiment.
 After that, I labeled each dish and secured it with a rubber band.
 Finally, I placed the petri dish under a 90
 electric blanket tent and observed and recorded the results for 5 days.
 I repeated these steps with different types and materials of shoes (7 pairs).
Rubber sandals and the two synthetic shoes ended up with the most bacterial count and the natural materials
(leather/cotton) had the least amount of bacteria in both agar types. I learned from research that the two agar types are pref
erred by
foot bacteria. So I used both types to repeat the same experiment. They both presented very similar pattern of bacterial grow
th.
My conclusion is that the materials of shoes affect the amount of bacteria. This may be caused by the breathable
characteristics of natural material so the moisture is aired out. On the other hand, the construction of shoes (e.g. open-toe
shoes)
did not affect the amount of bacteria. The contact surface between skin and shoes produce enough moisture with synthetic mater
ial
that the “openness” did not seem to reduce the amount of bacteria.
