To determine whether if you can decrypt messages done with a one-time pad (an encryption key
using a randomizing algorithms which is designed to be used only once) if you have 2 messages sent with the
same set of letters.
You will need one computer, a program to encrypt messages with a one-time pad (I used the
Solitaire Algorithm), and 2 messages encrypted with the same key. I developed a program for file subtraction
reasoning that I could use it to get the guessed key from one message, which would be tested, on the other
message. That would enable me to decrypt the message
You can decrypt messages sent with a one-time pad if the sender makes the mistake of using the one-
time pad twice
The most modern form of encryption, quantum cryptography, stems from the one-time pad. This is
the most secure form of encryption because trying to test every key will generate every sensible message of the
message#s length making it impossible to tell which is the right one. The total number of messages for 15 letters
is 1*10^12 messages of which a third would probably be sensible to a computer screening program designed to
detect the most frequent letters and digraphs, assuming you have the right language. However all of this work
does not need to be done if the mistake is made of using the one time pad twice.
