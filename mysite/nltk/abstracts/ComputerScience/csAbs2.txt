To see the effect of varying the food supply in a simulated population of evolving cellular automata.
Too little food will cause the creatures to starve. Too much food will lead to overpopulation, and
the food will all be eaten, again causing the creatures to starve.
I taught myself the Java(TM) Programming Language using the online tutorials, and with help from
my father. I then wrote a computer program for the cellular automata.
Each simulated creature moves around a "universe" looking for food; if it does not find food within a certain
time, it dies. If two creatures encounter each other, they might produce a new creature. The patterns of
movement and behavior on encountering another creature are encoded in "genes"; new creatures inherit a mix of
their parent’s genes, and might also have some mutations.
The program was run a number of times with a fixed initial population, varying the rate of food supplies.
The final population size was recorded after each run.
The results showed that if the rate of food supply was very low, the final population size was very small
or zero. If the rate of food supply was very high, the final population was also low.
The food supply affects the population growth as predicted: too little food leads to starvation, and
too much food leads to overpopulation followed by starvation before the creatures have had time to evolve into
better food gatherers.
