My goal was to write a computer program that would allow the sending of files and messages, and open chat over
a loca area network. It had to simple enough for children and adults with no computer experience to use. It had to operate
without a fixed server. Finally, it had to have a password protection system in place that could be used when security was
necessary.
Network Intercomm (NIC) is written in the C++ programming language using the Microsoft Foundation
Classes and many classes that I wrote myself. It makes use of Windows Sockets which provide a fast and efficient way to
transfer information without requiring the sharing of hard drives. All data transfer is run through a single socket in the
main thread.
NIC has been tested on multiple LANs and is in use at First Christian Academy in Columbus, Ohio. It works
better than I had ever expected. It works equally well on Windows 95, 98, and 2000. I’m fairly certain it will also work on
NT, although that remains to be tested. It is simple and intuitive to use, even without reading the help file. It also comes
complete with an easy to use installer. All aspects of the program are functioning perfectly.
NIC may not have all the features of Microsoft Exchange, but it has enough to suit the average person’s
needs. The lack of complexity has the advantage of making NIC simple and easy to use. It works very well on a small
LAN. Each computer is a single node, separate from the rest of the network. There is no server, and there are no clients.
This makes NIC a better choice for small LANs, many of which don’t have servers running all the time.
