My objective is to find out which method of distilling saltwater produces more fresh water in the least
time. I predict that solar evaporation will produce less water than electric evaporation but more than natural evaporation.
A solar box was constructed to measure 3 cups of saltwater to be distilled and
produce freshwater. Plexiglass with a black bottom was used to conduct the suns heat and collect distilled freshwater.
The solar distillation box was placed outdoors to distill the water and measure data. Next I compared the solar to an
electric evaporation process using an electric stove. I also compared the solar rate to natural evaporation using a jar in the
sun.
The results proved that solar distillation was in between the electric and natural methods. Electric distillation
went faster and natural took longer. The solar was in between for producing fresh water. The solar distilled about 1/4 cup
of water on average for 4 hours with full sun. Natural evaporation was about 1 cup a month. Electric is very constant
producing 1 cup an hour at a medium temperature.
My hypothesis was exactly what I figured it to be. My solar box worded correctly
except for a few leaks in the first try. I liked to see how much freshwater the solar box produced each day. I even tasted
the distilled water. One of the interesting things of this experiment was the collection of the salt from the three different
methods. If a company were to build a distillation plant it should be a solar because it produces closely to electric speed
and is cheaper in the long run. A model such as the one I built could be made into a kit for survival on the ocean.
