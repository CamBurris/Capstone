Most people have heard about the greenhouse effect and global warming in the news recently,
and we did our experiment to demonstrate these two procedures on a smaller scale. We created
two, miniature enclosed environments, labeled #1 and #2, and used dry ice to represent carbon
dioxide emissions. We placed 3 grams of dry ice in #1 five days a week for four weeks. We
also took dirt samples from both environments at the beginning, middle, and end of our project
to streak onto agar petri dishes in order to observe bacterial colonies. From our overall results,
we found that #2(not exposed to added carbon dioxide) was dramatically healthier and lusher
than #1 (exposed to added carbon dioixde). The plants were fuller and greener in #2. We also
took the temperatures from both environments each day and found that the overall temperature
in Environment #1 was significantly higher than #2. We concluded that excess carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere indeed does have an effect on its surrounding environment.
