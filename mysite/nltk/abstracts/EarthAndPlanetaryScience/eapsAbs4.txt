The purpose of this project was to explain why we see moon phases and how the
moon effects the ocean tides.
We gathered as much research information as possible from the library and the internet.
We studied the information and wrote a report explaining moon phases and the moons effect on the
tides. We then made a model showing the moon phases, drew diagrams to explain and show the Neap
and Spring Tides and made a "Tide Dial" which demonstrates why there are two high tides a day
around the world. An oral report was given to our class.
We educated ourselves and others about the moons effect here on Earth. Our models
help give a clear picture to go with our explanations.
We have learned a lot about the Moon Phases and Tides. We know that we have
tides mainly because of the Moon’s gravitational pull on the Earth.
