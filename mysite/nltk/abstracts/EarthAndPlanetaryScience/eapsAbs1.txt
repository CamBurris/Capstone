Cases of water shortages around the world have caught my attention. In order to learn about one of
the possible ways to slow the process of evaporation, I have chosen to answer the question #Does oil
film have an effect on the evaporation rate of water?# In other words, does placing a thin oil film over
the surface of water slow its evaporation rate?
First, I had 4 different types of oil consisting of corn, soybean, vegetable, and sesame oil. For each
of these four oils, I had 16 cups of water divided into 4 sets of 4, all having the same amount. In the
1st set of each oil group I placed one drop of that oil into the cup. 20 drops were placed in 4 other
cups of water of the 2nd set of each oil group. An oily finger was merely swished through the cups of
the four others in the 3rd set, and the last 4 sets had no oil at all, this would be the control. All of the
16 trials were placed under the same conditions. Every other day, I measured and recorded the water
levels in each of the 64 glasses of water for a period of 2 weeks.
After conducting the experiment I found that all of the water in glasses containing at least one drop
of oil or more, evaporated slower than the ones without oil (control). The cups containing 20 drops of
oil turned out to be the ones with more water.
Thanks to all the people who have helped me throughout the course of this project. Thanks to my
mother, Mrs. Smith, the librarians at BPL, and to all the teachers.
