Experiments were performed to determine whether there is a low cost, low tech way to build
homes out of recycled paper. The material that would was tested is an experimental material
called papercrete which is a mixture of recycled paper, concrete, sand, and water. My
hypothesis was that recycled paper can be made into homes in a low cost, low tech way. All of
the tests performed were designed to find the maximum rate of stress that the material could
withstand without failure and compare those results to the minimum standard for the rate of
failure of the most comparable building material, which is adobe brick. If papercrete could
exceed the minimum standards for adobe, then it could be or should be approved for use as a
building material in place of other already accepted materials.
My results show papercrete passing the minimum standards for all of the tests made.
My conclusion is that papercrete bricks would most likely be a strong building material. It
could also be used as a substitute for wood that would also provide good insulation.
