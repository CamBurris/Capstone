To prove that an application of a clay flocculate onto a harmful algae bloom will mitigate the
number of cells in the bloom, thus reducing or eliminating the effects of the bloom on the surrounding
environment.
A net was used to collect a two liter sample of plankton and water from San Diego
Bay. This two liter sample was separated into two 1,000 milliliter graduated cylinders, one was a control, the
other was for the experiment. Three drops of water were drawn from the top, middle and bottom of the control
cylinder, and the abundance and diversity of plankton was noted using a Swift field microscope. A measured
quantity of a clay slurry (flocculate) was then applied to the surface of the target cylinder. Three drops of water
were then drawn from the top, middle and bottom of the target cylinder and the plankton were counted using
the same methodology.
Three out of five tests showed successful mitigation of plankton in the water column. It was also
discovered that the clay flocculate ionized (bonded) with the cells of both harmless and harmful plankton. The
plankton population in the target cylinder was reduced from 9 to 83 percent.
The application of a clay flocculate would be successful in mitigating or maybe even stopping a
harmful algae bloom (HAB) event. Red and brown tides (HAB) contain dangerous amounts of naturally
occurring toxins that can cause symptoms ranging from seizures to death in both aquatic and land mammals.
