My project is to see if my energy consumption can be offset by the sources falling in 20 sq. m. of my back yard.
This is a continuation of my project from Spring 2000. The purpose of that project was to calculate if I could
use compressed air as an energy storage medium. That was feasible, so I continued collecting data on energy
demand and supply for the entire year. I collected data on solar energy using a photovoltaic cell and a solar
powered Sterling engine; on wind energy using an anemometer; on rain energy using a rain gauge. These were
recorded every 15 minutes for 14 months. I logged my personal energy consumption for 1 week each month. I
calculated the theoretical total energy based on the sum of:
Wind turbines for wind energy,
Solar panels for photovoltaic sun energy,
Sterling engines for thermal sun energy,
A water turbine for rain falling on my roof.
Each device was scaled from the collected data.
From last year, I knew that there would be surplus energy times and deficit times and that energy storage is
necessary. My new data confirmed that compressed air pumped storage is still feasible and led me to a startling
conclusion on my energy self-reliance.
