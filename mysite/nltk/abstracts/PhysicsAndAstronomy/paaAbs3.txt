My goal in this project was to find the energy of alpha particles through observation of their tracks as seen in a
cloud chamber.
To find the energy of the alpha particles, I first built a diffusion cloud chamber. The current
chamber is the third I have built in the course of this experiment. The sponges in the top of the chamber are saturated with
Methyl alcohol and pellet dry ice is placed underneath. An alpha source of Polonium-210 was placed inside. Once the
bottom temperature reached approx. -30 degrees C, tracks began to form in the layer of sensitivity. The tracks were then
photographed with a digital camera and enhanced on a computer with a graphics package. Once printed out, I measured
the tracks with a ruler included in the photograph and recorded the results. 75 tracks in some 40 photographs were used as
data. The median track length was calculated and the particle energy determined using a graph from W.A.Bethe.
The median track length was 20 cm. Baed on the work of Bethe, alpha particles having this as range would have
an energy of 3.5 MeV.
The proven energy of alpha particles emmitted by Polonium-210 is 5.5 MeV. My results are considerably
lower than this. There are two likely resons for this. First, if the particle’s path is upward, the track would be shorter th
an
the range of the particle because it would leave the layer of sensitivity. Second, I cannot be sure of the exact location of
the point on the source needle where the particle is emmitted. So while the energy of alpha particles can be determined
from their track length, the chamber used must be capable of showing tracks for their entire range. I’m still thinking about
how to do that
