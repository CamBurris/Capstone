The purpose of this experiment was to find out how long it takes the Sun to rotate. My hypothesis was that
the rotation of the Sun would take 23 to 28 days at its equator, and sunspots would be visible for no longer than
14 days at its equator and 16 days at its poles.
A reflecting telescope was used to focus an image of the Sun onto a cardboard screen. A picture of the
image of the Sun was then taken with a digital camera. This procedure was repeated 23 times over a period of
about 6 weeks. The paths of the sunspots were traced on transparency paper, and the latitude and longitude of
each sunspot on each day were measured. This information was entered into an Excel spread sheet. The change
in longitude was used to calculate the rotation per day in degrees. The time it would take for the Sun to make a
complete rotation was then calculated.
The average rotation rate of the sunspots per day was 13.7 degrees. From this the average rotation period of
the Sun would be 26.6 days. The slowest moving sunspot averaged 11.0 degrees per day. At that rate, the Sun
would take 34.7 days to rotate. The fastest moving sunspot averaged 16 degrees per day. At that rate, the Sun
would take 22.5 days to rotate. No relationship was observed between rotation rate and sunspot latitude for
latitudes between plus and minus 30&#61616;. This experiment suggests the Sun does not rotate at a constant
rate, but it is hard to distinguish between Sun rotation rate changes and measurement error.
